        "question": "With respect to the summary narrative illustrating revenues that the State\nand localities will receive from the proposed gaming facility (.StateLocalRevenue):\nWhat constitutes a “comparable casino project”?\nA.448: See answer to Question 438.\nQ.449: Does “within 50 miles” apply to driving distance or a straight line?\nA.449: Driving distance.\nQ.450: Why does the average case assume a comparable casino project outside the\n50-mile range, but the high-case and low-case scenarios do not include a comparable\ncasino project outside the 50-mile range?\nA.450: The RFA speaks for itself in this regard.\nQ.451: If the reference to comparable casino outside the 50-mile range does not\nregard existing casinos (e.g., the two Connecticut casinos, existing Atlantic City\ncasinos, etc.) please provide additional guidance on location.\nA.451: The Applicant needs to make assumptions of the likely size and\nimpacts of other potential competition.\nQ.452: Does the average case imply a scenario where the GFLB issues two casino\nlicenses, rather than up to three?\nA.452: The RFA speaks for itself in this regard.\nQ.453: Does the low-case basis imply a scenario where the GFLB issues all three\ncasino licenses?\nA.453: The RFA speaks for itself in this regard.\nQ.454: The RFA requires applicants to prepare and provide an independent\nanalysis of certain financial and tax revenue projections “over the existing use of\nland at the gaming facility site.” For purpose of such analysis, does “existing use”\nmean the actual current use of the facility site in its current state of improvement\nand development, or the tax revenue which the facility site would be expected to\ngenerate if improved and developed to the extent permitted by current zoning?\nA.454: The use of the property in its current state.\nPage | 76\nQ.455: Page 30 of the RFA outlines the high-case, average case and low-case basis,\nwhich are defined by the projects within certain geographical radii. More\nspecifically, the high-case assumes that “there are no comparable casino projects\nwithin 50 miles of the proposed facility.” Can the GFLB confirm that the RFA is\nasking the Applicants to ignore existing VLg Facilities that may be already located\nwithin those radii?\nA.455: See answer to Question 438.\nQ.456: Given the population density downstate and the fact that distance is more\naccurately calculated by time rather than mileage, will the GFLB consider travel\ntime, borough boundaries and overall traffic impacts, rather than just geographical\ndistance, as the basis for distinguishing between the high-case, average-case and\nlow-case projections?\nA.456: No.\nQ.457: The RFA states the high-case would assume that there are no comparable\ncasino projects within 50 miles of the proposed facility.\n(a) Does this mean drive miles or “as the crow flies” miles?\n(b) Does this mean N.Y.S. casinos only?\n(c) Does this apply to proposed casinos only?\nA.457: See the answers to Questions 438, 445 and 449, respectively.\nQ.458: Why was the 50-mile radius determined to be the metric?\nA.458: 50 miles is the radius that the GLFB determined appropriate.\nQ.459: Based on public announcements, it appears the majority of proposed casino\nproject sites will be roughly 25 or less “as the crow flies” miles from each other.\nGiven the request on page 30 of the RFA to show high-, average- and low-case\nimpacts from comparable casino projects, will the GFLB accept an analysis that\nuses a smaller radius than 50 miles if the applicant can demonstrate that a smaller\nradius is more appropriate to capture the market dynamics and publicly announced\nsite locations?\nA.459: See answer to Question 438.\nQ.460: Why is the assumption that education revenues are 80 percent of the total?\nPage | 77\nA.460: See N.Y. State Finance Law § 97-nnnn(3)(a).\nQ.461. Will a net present value of tax revenues be utilized?\nA.461: The valuation methodology has not been determined yet.\nQ.462: Under the requested “High Case Scenario,” which suggests the Applicant\nassume “there are no comparable casino projects within 50 miles of the proposed\nfacility,” please confirm this scenario should assume that the existing facilities in\nYonkers and Flushing remain as VLG only for purposes of this scenario.\nA.462: See answer to Question 437, and note that there is no VLG facility in\nFlushing.\nQ.463: What assumptions should the market studies make regarding online gaming\nin the state of New York?\nA.463: When preparing its response, the Applicant should assume the\ncurrent landscape of legalized gambling in New York.\nQ.464: Should applicants include the annual machine and table fees imposed under\nPML § 1348 in the summary of State revenues to be disclosed on the Return Date\nand the Supplement Return Date?\nA.464: Yes.\nMinimum Capital Investment\nQ.465: Will the GFLB consider pre-capital investment amounts to be included in\nthe minimum $500 million balance?\nA.465: The GFLB has not advised as to whether pre-capital investment will\nbe included.\nQ.466: In connection with the submission of a detailed summary of capital\ninvestments that will be made prospectively if the Applicant receives a gaming\nfacility license, what evidence or back-up is required to be submitted to determine\nthe projected costs of: pre‐opening purchase of furniture, fixtures, equipment,\ngaming equipment, information technology equipment and personal property to be\nused within the gaming facility?\nPage | 78\nA.466: Please see answer to Question 465.\nQ.467: In connection with the submission of a detailed summary of capital\ninvestments that will be made prospectively if the Applicant receives a gaming\nfacility license, does the summary of percentage of each investment made towards\nfirms in the host community pertain only to donations and community\nimprovements?\nA.467: Refer to the description of the Capital Investment outlined on page\n29 of the RFA.\nQ.468: Is it appropriate to assume that the request for the percentage of each\ninvestment “that will be to firms located in the host community, the host\nmunicipality and the state” refers to each of the categories of capital spending\nspecified in the preceding bullets (actual construction, site prep, environmental\nremediation, professional services, FFE etc.)?\nA.468: Yes.\nQ.469: Could the GFLB clarify if “.CapitalInvestmentDetails” is seeking a summary\nof infrastructure improvement and construction associated with the Application or\nonly those elements eligible in calculating the Minimum Capital Investment, as\ndefined?\nA.469: .CapitalInvestmentDetails should include only those elements\neligible in calculating the Minimum Capital Investment.\nQ.470: Please clarify if there is a difference between the various uses of the term\n\"host\" in relation to community and municipality.\nA.470: Yes. The term Host Municipality is defined. The term host\ncommunity should encompass areas surrounding and adjacent to the\nproposed facility. By way of illustration, if this process were for siting in\nanother jurisdiction and an applicant used Washington, D.C. as a Host\nMunicipality, the host community would incorporate Alexandria and\nArlington, Va., and Silver Spring, Md.\nQ.471: For purposes of calculating the “Minimum Capital Investment,” the\nApplicant is allowed to include certain professional fees. Do these professional fees\ninclude fees paid to accountants and consultants engaged by the Applicant to assist\nin preparing the Application?\nPage | 79\nA.471: No, to the extent that such costs do not represent indirect and\noverhead costs related to the development of the gaming facility.\nQ.472: The RFA states that the GFLB may consider private investments made by\nthe Applicant prior to April 9, 2022. Will the GFLB consider any such private\ninvestment made by an affiliate of an applicant?\nA.472: The RFA states that the GFLB would consider whether capital\ninvestment made prior to April 9, 2022 would count towards the\ncalculation of minimum capital investment. The GFLB encourages\nApplicant's to include the reasons why such amounts should be considered\nin their submissions.\nQ.473: For purposes of determining the length of the initial term of a gaming\nfacility license, how is the “total investment” in an applicant’s project defined?\nA.473: Total investment is defined as all elements of Minimum Capital\nInvestment. An Applicant may also include other items that it wishes the\nGFLB to consider as investment and the reason supporting such\nconsideration.\nQ.474: Is total investment determined in the same manner as “minimum capital\ninvestment”?\nA.474: See answer to Question 473.\nQ.475: How will the GFLB normalize applications that involve adaptive reuse of\nexisting structures as against applications that require ground-up construction?\nA.475: PML § 1321-e(1) allows for the GFLB to evaluate Applications that\ninclude adaptive reuse of existing structures. At this time, the GFLB has\nnot established criteria for such evaluation. An Applicant is encouraged to\ninclude the value of its requested credit for adaptive reuse and\njustification for why such amount should be considered.\nQ.476: How will the GFLB evaluate the value of existing structures as opposed to\nground-up construction of a new gaming facility and the cost associated with\nobtaining vacant possession of those structures, when considering an Applicant’s\nMinimum Capital Investment?\nPage | 80\nA.476: At this time, the GFLB has not established criteria for such\nevaluation as it relates to Minimum Capital Investment.\nQ.477: The RFA does not appear to exclude from the calculation of an Applicant’s\nMinimum Capital Investment, the costs and investments required to be made for a\nsite that is subject to a general project plan which already obligates the owner to\ninvest and build on the location. Are we correct that in such instances, only the\nincremental investment over and above commitments under an existing general\nproject plan will be considered for purposes of the Minimum Capital Investment\ncalculations?\nA.477: Yes.\nQ.478: Should the Minimum Capital Investment exclude government or State\nfunding or subsidies?\nA.478: While nothing in statute or RFA directly prevents use of applicable\nState and local economic development programs, a factor for the graded\nRFA evaluation is economic impact, and a subsidized application will\nlikely illustrate diminished economic impacts when competitively\nevaluated.\nQ.479: Please confirm that ALL soft cost including consultant fees, pre-opening\nfees, marketing fees, FFE, OS&E, cost to prepare RFA, etc. should be included in\nthe capital investment submission.\nA.479: Please see answer to Question 471.\nQ.480: In the event that one of the existing video lottery gaming facilities is selected\nas one of the licensees, would such facility be required to spend and/or complete the\nminimum of $500M prior to being granted the opportunity to offer table games?\nA.480: An Application submitted by a video lottery gaming facility is\nrequired to meet all aspects of RFA requirements that are applicable to\ngreenfield development.\nMitigating Potential Impacts on Municipalities\nQ.481: With respect to “revenue and visitation projections,” should the independent\nexpert’s local economic impact study utilize the Applicant’s own revenue and\nPage | 81\nvisitation projections or those forecasted within the “full independent market\nstudy”?\nA.481: Applicants should use the full independent market study.\nQ.482: Please confirm that the portions of the Local Economic Impact Study\n(.LocalEconImpactStudy) that correspond to impact analyses conducted pursuant to\nSEQRA/CEQR may be submitted on the Supplement Return Date, following\ncompletion of SEQRA/CEQR environmental review, and do not need to be submitted\non the Return Date. If at the time of the initial return date an Applicant is\nundertaking impact analysis pursuant to SEQRA/CEQR, can Applicant submit a\nlist of the technical areas that will be studied, a description of the methodology that\nwill be used to study them, and, if an EAS and Positive Declaration have been\nissued as of the Initial Return Date, the areas where potential impacts have been\nidentified by the lead agency for purposes of further study in an EIS?",
        "answer": "An Applicant should submit as complete a response as possible by\nthe Return Date for the exhibit to be labelled .LocalEconImpactStudy, as\nsuch information will be relevant to CAC consideration. To the extent that\nsuch submission requires modification during the progress of statutory\nenvironmental reviews, the Applicant may request that the GFLB accept\nan updated submission for this exhibit.\nQ.483: If at the time of the initial return date an Applicant is undertaking impact\nanalysis pursuant to SEQRA/CEQR, can Applicant submit a list of the technical\nareas that will be studied, a description of the methodology that will be used to\nstudy them, and, if an EAS and Positive Declaration have been issued as of the\nInitial Return Date, the areas where potential impacts have been identified by the\nlead agency for purposes of further study in an EIS?\nA.483: See answer to Question 482.\nQ.484: Is the establishment of an on-site child day care program a requirement?\nA.484: The statute states that an on-site day care program is not a\nrequirement but is a component of evaluation. The Workforce\nEnhancement section of the RFA that concerns on-site day care should be\nread in a light reflective of PML § 1321-j(3)(d)(3).\nQ.485: Are the three areas of geographic study for the Economic Impact Analysis\nthe Host Municipality, Region, and State?\nPage | 82\nA.485: Yes.\nQ.486: For the Local Economic Impact Analysis, is the geography of affected\ngovernments/communities the same as for the Economic Impact Analysis (e.g., Host\nMunicipality, Region and State)?\nA.486: Yes.\nQ.487: For the Local Economic Impact Analysis, reference is made to impact on\nnearby localities and/or municipalities. Is this a different geography than as defined\nby the Region?\nA.487: The terminology in this section is imprecise. The terms\n\"surrounding localities\" and \"nearby municipalities\" should be considered\ninterchangeable.\nQ.488: Should potential impact categories be analyzed in comparison to the\nassumed no-build background condition in the comparable year, and not in\ncomparison to existing conditions?\nA.488: We do not understand how the existing condition differs from the\nno-build condition.\nQ.489: Is there an agreed-upon methodology that the GFLB will use to give value to\nthe positive environmental impact, the minimal displacement, and the overall\nreduced carbon footprint resulting from using an existing structure?\nA.489: The Applicant should submit its estimation of positive\nenvironmental impact and its methodology for determining such.\nQ.490: What is the definition of economic plan?\nA.490: The customary and general use of this term applies.\nQ.491: Please explain the differences and definitions of \"local\" versus \"regional\" for\neconomic studies?\nA.491: Local should include the host community where the facility is\nlocated, while regional should include surrounding municipalities.\nPage | 83\nQ.492: Will the GFLB accept bids that partner with local childcare providers (to\nfurther support and not disrupt such local providers) in lieu of constructing a new\nand potentially duplicative “on-site” childcare center?\nA.492: PML § 1321-j(3)(d)(3) provides that on-site day care is not a\nrequirement but is a component of evaluation. An Applicant partnering\nwith a local childcare program will be affirmatively evaluated concerning\nthat component of its Application.\nQ.493: If an Applicant proposes a residential component integrated within its\nproject, will such component be considered part of the gaming facility?\nA.493: It is incumbent upon the Applicant to define what it believes to be\nthe gaming facility it proposes.\nQ.494: Please define \"underserved communities.\"\nA.494: Underserved communities shall be defined as populations sharing a\nparticular characteristic, as well as geographic communities, who have\nbeen systematically denied a full opportunity to participate in aspects of\neconomic, social, and civic life.\nQ.495: Please define \"small business.\"\nA.495: A small business shall be deemed to be one that is resident in this\nState, independently owned and operated, not dominant in its field, and\nthat employs 100 or fewer persons.\nQ.496: Please define local, as in “local nonprofit services.”\nA.496: Local should include the host community where the facility is\nlocated.\nNon-Collusive Bidding\nQ.497: With regard to restricted behavior and ethical conduct by Applicants, will\nthe GFLB issue and enforce rules that prohibit material interference with fair\ncompetition among Applicants?\nA.497: The GFLB has not considered the issuance of such conduct-related\nrules.\nPage | 84\nOrganizational Documents\nQ.498: Do executed or binding joint venture or partnership agreements need to be\nin place or may term sheets, draft agreements or something more generic suffice?\nA.498: Please refer to page 23 of the RFA, Organizational Documents.\nPartnerships with Entertainment Venues\nQ.499: Does the term “live entertainment venue” include theaters, movie theaters,\nrestaurants, concert venues, health clubs, etc.?\nA.499: RFA page 33 outlines specific examples of live entertainment\nvenues.

Otherwise,\nrecords of such information may be published in an unredacted form.\nPublic Officials\nQ.556: How should a tribal gaming authority respond to the section concerning\nPublic Officials contacts, as on its face it would require listing every tribal official\nand every employee if this section were read to include tribal governments?\nA.556: Please see answer to Question 21. Accordingly, tribal government\nofficials are not responsive to this section.\nPublic Presentations\nQ.557: What is the estimated time allotted for Stage 2 public presentations?\nA.557: The GFLB has not established parameters concerning public\npresentations. However, public presentations are likely to be similar to the\n2014 process, which is listed here.\nQ.558: How long did Applicants have to present public presentations undertaken\nduring the upstate casino licensing process?\nA.558: Please see answer to Question 557.\nQ.559: In addition to live entertainment venues, will the GFLB permit other\ncommunity constituents (including hotels, retailers, restaurants, other local\nbusiness owners, local universities, and other impacted businesses) to appear and\nbe granted the same standing as live entertainment venues?\nA.559: The limitation concerning live entertainment venues derives from\nPML § 1321-j(2)(c).\nQuestions and Inquiries\nQ.560: Is an Applicant permitted to include material in appendices?\nPage | 94\nA.560: No. All materials relating to a question must be contained in the\ndesignated file-name convention.\nQ.561: Is it possible that additional rounds of questions beyond the two listed will\nbe scheduled?\nA.561: No additional rounds are contemplated at this time.\nRequirements Before Board Review\nQ.562: Given that a land use application at the NYC Department of City Planning\ntakes 18 to 24+ months on average to process (including pre-certification,\nenvironmental review, and ULURP), how will the GFLB see the land use timeline\nwork with the CAC and GFLB review timeline?\nA.562: See answer to Question 267.\nQ.563: Please confirm that the Application fee is due on the Return Date.\nA.563: Confirmed.\nSchedule\nQ.564: The RFA states that full completion of all zoning approvals must be obtained\nbefore the GFLB may evaluate an application. What if zoning approval is not\ncomplete before the Application deadline?\nA.564: Pursuant to the RFA, at page 26, the Application will not advance if\nthe required actions, including evidence of compliance with zoning\nrequirement, are not accomplished by the Supplement Return Date.\nQ.565: What if zoning approval is not complete before the Supplement Return\nDate?\nA.565: See answer to Question 564.\nQ.566: How may an Applicant withdraw its Application?\nA.566: An Applicant may withdraw by correspondence from the Applicant's\nDesignated Contact to the Commission's Designated Contact.\nPage | 95\nQ.567: The RFA provides that “by the supplement return date” both Evidence of\nPublic Support and Evidence of Compliance with Zoning requirements “must take\nplace for the Board to commence an official review.” The timeline provided in the\nRFA contemplates that the CAC approval process takes place before an Applicant\nsubmits its proposal to local zoning authorities. How much time does the GFLB\ncontemplate between the CAC vote and an Applicant’s submission demonstrating\nevidence of compliance with zoning requirements?\nA.567: An Applicant may submit its proposal to applicable zoning\nauthorities at any time, even before the Return Date. (The last row of\nStage 1 elements on page 5 of the RFA is not intended to follow the CAC\nvote.) The Commission presumes that the zoning process has already\ncommenced. The GFLB will announce a zoning completion deadline as a\ncomponent of Stage 2 of the process and had not determined such date at\nthis time.\nQ.568: Is an applicant selected by the GFLB or the Commission?\nA.568: The GFLB evaluates Applications and selects Applicants to advance\nto the Commission for the Commission’s licensure consideration pursuant\nto PML §§ 1321-f, 1321-g and 1321-h.\nQ.569: Will the Commission commit to deadlines concerning responses to questions\nposed?\nA.569: There were no deadlines included in the RFA timeline.\nQ.570: In previous RFP’s, the Commission took between two and four weeks to\nrespond to questions. Does the Commission believe it will take a similar amount of\ntime in this process?\nA.570: Obviously, no.\nQ.571: Given the variability of time and complexity in receiving zoning and land-\nuse approvals among the applicants, will the GFLB evaluate applications for license\naward only once all of the Applicants have completed the process, irrespective of\nhow long it takes?\nA.571: Yes. However, the GFLB will establish a timeline providing all\nApplicants a reasonable amount of time to obtain CAC and zoning\napprovals for their proposed projects.\nPage | 96\nAlcoholic Beverage Licensing\nQ.572: Will the Commission follow the same process with respect to the issuance of\nliquor licenses to the winning bidder(s)?\nA.572: It is anticipated that the present consideration of Casino Alcoholic\nBeverage Licenses will be followed for new gaming facility licensees.\nStructure\nQ.573: Please clarify the differences between the Revenue Study and the Market\nStudy.\nA.573: The Market Study is where Applicant plans on drawing its\ncustomers from, while the Revenue Study details the revenue derived from\nsuch customers.\nQ.574: What is meant by “The Applicant, if applicable, has waived a potential\nrecoverable license fee amount”?\nA.574: This language is no longer applicable, as the period subject to the\nrecoverable license fee, as set forth in PML § 1311(1), has expired.\nQ.575: What specific information will be provided in the scenario worksheet?\nA.575: The contents of the scenario worksheet will be available upon\nrelease of the worksheet.\nQ.576: At what point will an Applicant need to agree to an imposed tax rate?\nA.576: The Applicant appears to misunderstand the process. On the\nSupplement Return Date (when the competitive landscape will be more\nevident), an Applicant shall propose tax rates applicable to its gaming\nfacility.\nQ.577: If an application fails to meet criteria or be considered by the GFLB, will the\nApplicant be notified immediately or have to wait until a short list is announced?\nA.577: The vote by the applicable CAC is an action that will take place in\nan open meeting. An Applicant will be in communication with the\napplicable zoning authority and will have the duty to demonstrate\nPage | 97\nsatisfaction of zoning compliance with its submission on the Supplement\nReturn Date.\nSupplement Return Date Materials\nQ.578: To the extent that visitation statistics are unavailable for casino properties\nthat would be considered “comparable,” will the GFLB provide visitation numbers\nfor the most directly comparable existing video lottery gaming facilities in the\ndownstate region for comparison purposes or otherwise provide additional guidance\non what may be used as an alternative comparison?\nA.578: It is incumbent upon the Applicant to undertake its own research.\nQ.579: The initial RFA submission asks for an independent market assessment of\ngaming revenue for a period of at least the first 5 years of operation and the\nsupplemental submission asks for the first 10 years of operation. Will 10 years be\nacceptable in both submissions?\nA.579: So long as the independent market assessment is a minimum of 5,\nthe requirement is satisfied.\nQ.580: If “none of the proposal parameters submitted in the first submission\n(including but not limited to: jobs, capital investment, gaming facility of the highest\ncaliber) should be amended,” why would the underlying projections of gaming\nrevenues and visitors change relative to the initial assessment?\nA.580: By the Supplement Return Date, the competitive landscape will be\nmore evident. Therefore, projections of gaming revenue and visitors might\nbe adjusted accordingly.\nQ.581: Due to the subjectivity of the Applicants’ views on the competitive market,\nforecasts of revenue and tax scenarios may widely vary. Can the GFLB provide a\nmore definitive competitive market supply outlook, so Applicants’ forecasts are\nmore directly comparable to one another?\nA.581: It is incumbent upon the Applicant to undertake its own research.\nQ.582: Applicants must submit a full independent market study, a revenue study\ncompleted by an independent expert and a description of the competitive\nenvironment in which the Applicant anticipates the proposed gaming facility will\noperate. For purposes of assessing the competitive impact of other gaming facilities\nPage | 98\non the applicant’s proposed gaming facility in the independent market study, what\ncompetitive gaming facilities should applicants assume will be licensed?\nA.582: It is incumbent upon the Applicant to undertake its own research.\nQ.583: With respect to the material to be submitted on the Supplement Return\nDate, will applicants be permitted to modify items not expressly restricted and to\nmodify items upward.\nA.583: No. An Applicant shall submit its best and final proposal at the\nSupplement Return Date. If selected, an Applicant may then modify its\nproposal upward.\nQ.584: How can the Commission have two different tax rates in the same region?\nA.584: The question appears to misunderstand the manner of setting tax\nrates. It is incumbent upon the Applicant by the Supplement Return Date,\nunderstanding the competitive landscape, to bid a rate that the Applicant\nis prepared to pay. This process may result in accepted proposals that\ndiffer among the ultimate gaming facility licensees.\nQ.585: Will a form or template of the “scenario worksheet” be provided to\nApplicants?\nA.585: Yes.\nQ.586: After the GFLB provides Applicants with a “scenario worksheet” it requests\nupdated proposals on gaming tax rates. Is the intent that such proposals will be\nentirely conditioned on the scenarios given?\nA.586: Presuming the questioner means that a proffered tax rate can be\nconditioned upon the number of competitive licenses issued, yes.\nQ.587: After the Return Date and prior to the Supplement Return Date, may an\nApplicant continue to supplement its initial submission responses?\nA.587: An Applicant has a continuing duty to disclose updates to its\nApplication. However, an Applicant must respond fully to required\nsections of the RFA by the Return Date. The GFLB may, in its sole\ndiscretion, determine to accept the update as an amendment to the\nApplication. See page 8 of the RFA.\nPage | 99\nQ.588: Will the scenario worksheet be provided after the GFLB announces the\nremaining Applicants?\nA.588: See answer to Question 612.\nTable of Ownership\nQ.589: Multi-Jurisdictional Personal History and New York Supplemental Form\nare required for a person having a beneficial interest of five percent or more of an\napplicant. Is the five percent based on actual or a look-through basis?\nA.589: We are unable to respond without a better understanding of the\nApplicant's ownership structure.\nQ.590: If a casino entity is owned 25 percent each by four entities (Holdco’s), one of\nwhich is an LLC having eight members, four of whom own 20 percent of Holdco and\nfour of whom own five percent of Holdco, are members owning percent of Holdco\nrequired to submit all the forms, since they each own less than two percent of the\napplicant?\nA.590. The GFLB will not entertain hypothetical scenarios.\nQ.591: Are applications and related disclosure forms required for an Indian tribe as\na result of its 25+ percent indirect ownership interest in Applicant?\nA.591: We are unable to respond without a better understanding of the\nApplicant's ownership structure.\nQ.592: Are applications and related disclosure forms required for an Indian tribe as\na result of its 100 percent indirect ownership interest in a gaming facility operator?\nA.592: Yes.\nQ.593: Please confirm whether the 5 percent ownership threshold should be based\non actual or beneficial ownership.\nA.593: See answer to Question 589.\nQ.594: The RFA requires documents that apply to “the Applicants’ owners.” Is this\nrequest limited to direct ownership or does it include indirect ownership as well?\nPage | 100\nA.594: We are unable to respond without a better understanding of the\nApplicant's ownership structure.\nGaming Taxation\nQ.595: Is the gaming taxation rate anticipated to be the same across all gaming\nfacility licensees or will it vary to reflect the differing scale of investment?\nA.595: See answer to Question 584.\nQ.596: Is it possible that the tax rate imposed on gross gaming revenue might be\ndifferent from the tax rate bid by an Applicant awarded the gaming facility license?\nA.596: No.\nQ.597: Is it possible for the Commission to determine the tax rate imposed on GGR\nto be different from the tax rate bid by the Applicant if the Applicant should be\nawarded the gaming facility license?\nA.597: See answer to Question 596.\nQ.598: Will the gross gaming taxation rates be uniform across the new gaming\nlicensees?\nA.598: See answer to Question 584.\nSustainable Development\nQ.599: Does “Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure techniques” refer to a specific\nstandard, specification, or guidance document?\nA.599: The Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure provides verification\nfor certain project assertions. Please refer to such organization’s website\nto better understand how a project component can be verified.\nhttps://sustainableinfrastructure.org/\nQ.600: Is there a threshold for what constitutes a “major source of energy\nconsumption”?\nA.600: The Applicant should apply industry standard to answer this\nquestion.\nPage | 101\nQ.601: What qualifies as a renewable energy source pursuant to New York State\nEnergy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) guidelines?\nA.601: Please refer to the NYSERDA website to better understand what\nqualifies.\nQ.602: If the renewable energy is procured off-site, must it have to be from the\nsame power zone as the facility?\nA.602: The RFA does not profess a preference.\nQ.603: Are the naming conventions for (.Electricity) and (.Renewable) swapped?\nA.603: The naming convention is irrelevant to content response.\nQ.604: Is the scoring for the Utilizing Sustainable Development Principals section\nall or nothing?\nA.604: A breakdown of the evaluation criteria is not presently\ncontemplated.\nQ.605: Are LEED requirements to be submitted by the Return Date or Supplement\nReturn Date?\nA.605: Return Date.\nQ.606: Does a facility need to meet a specific level of LEED certification?\nA.606: LEED certification is not a requirement but will enhance evaluation\nfor the applicable section.\nWorkforce Development Plan\nQ.607: Please define vicinity in the context of in “the vicinity of the Gaming\nFacility.”\nA.607: Please see answer to Question 167.\nQ.608: With respect to the Applicant being required to provide the composition of\nthe workforce broken down by part-time and “permanent positions,” does\n“permanent” mean “full-time” employees?\nPage | 102\nA.608: In the context of the question asked, yes.\nQ.609: How does the Workforce Development Plan compare to the requirement to\nprovide the highest number of quality jobs?\nA.609: The RFA speaks for itself.\nQ.610: Given that construction trades rotate in and out of a project at different\nphases of construction, how should applicants calculate an FTE worker?\nA.610: FTE workers should be calculated by projecting anticipated\nscheduled hours over a defined period.\nQ.611: Will the State establish baseline required thresholds (minimum\npercentages) for the number of positions to be filled by State residents, region\nresidents, host municipality residents, and nearby municipality residents?\nA.611: The GFLB and the Commission do not intend to establish a baseline\nrequirement.\nQ.612: When will the GFLB provide Applicants with the scenario worksheet?\nA.612: The date for the release of the scenario worksheet has not yet been\nestablished.\nQ.613: What factors will the GFLB consider in setting the Stage 2 Supplement\nReturn Date?\nA.613: The GFLB intends to provide all Applicants a reasonable amount of\ntime to obtain zoning approval for their proposed projects.\n[nothing follows]\nPage | 103"
