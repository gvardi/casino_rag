        "question": "The answer to Question 287 states that on the Return Date, the Applicant\nmust provide a description of what will be required “for entitlement to construct\npursuant to applicable zoning law, including, without limitation, a realistic timeline\nand milestones for achievement of entitlement to construct.” In NYC, the\nDepartment of Building issues permits to construct; however, DOB’s ability to issue\nbuilding permits is ministerial and therefore, not an “entitlement,” which is more\ntypically discretionary in nature. Is it Gaming Facility Location Board’s preference\nthat Applicants list all permits required whether discretionary or ministerial?",
        "answer": "An Applicant must provide a general outline of permits that will be\nrequired but will not need a list of every individual permit that may be\nneeded."

For example, street demapping and alienation of\nparkland? Compliance with Building Code, Energy Code, and Fire Code? Etc.?",

        "question": "The answer to Question 284 assumes that SEQRA will be required to obtain\nzoning approvals. If gaming facilities in New York City are “deemed zoning\ncompliant” and therefore require no discretionary approvals from the City, is there\n93\nthen no discretionary action subject to SEQRA, and therefore no environmental\nreview documentation required as part of an Applicant’s response to the RFA?",
